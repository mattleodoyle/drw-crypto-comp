# Crypto Market Prediction

This repository contains exploratory data analysis and machine learning models for the DRW Crypto Market Prediction challenge.

## Overview

- Comprehensive EDA of crypto market data
- Feature selection and engineering
- Implementation of various regression models
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Prediction generation

## Requirements

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- lightgbm

## Usage

The main analysis is contained in `testbed.ipynb`.





DRAFT:

Possible Model Paths:

- Generous Feature Selection
- Neural Network (Choose arch)
- Using Bayesian Optimization (with GP) for Hyper-params. Setting Prior based on basic grid search
- Then Train Final Model with all available training data

OR

- Straight up GP could be good

OR

- Same as first
- Instead build BNN using Hiearchical learning to control dead nuerons.
